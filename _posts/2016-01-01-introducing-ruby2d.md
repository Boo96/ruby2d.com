After a few years of experimenting and building prototypes, Iâ€™m excited to finally introduce Ruby 2D to the world with a [first beta release](https://github.com/ruby2d/ruby2d/releases/tag/v0.2.0).

Over the next few months, I'll share more about the project and my hopes for it. There's a lot left to do, but first, I just wanted to ship it, get people using it and start giving feedback. So, go on and [try it out](/learn/get-started/)!

Check back here for updates, view the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/ruby2d/ruby2d), and learn how to [contribute](/contribute). You can send feedback directly to [hello@ruby2d.com](hello@ruby2d.com) or tweet me at [@blacktm](https://twitter.com/blacktm).

Enjoy, and happy new year! ðŸŽ‰
