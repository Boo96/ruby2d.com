## Creating your first app

With Ruby 2D, you can create 2D applications, games, and visualizations with ease. Just a few lines of code is enough to get you started.

```ruby
require 'ruby2d'

# Set the window size
set width: 300, height: 200

# Create a new shape
s = Square.new

# Give it some color
s.color = 'red'

# Show the window
show
```
