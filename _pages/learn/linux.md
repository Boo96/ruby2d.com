# Install Ruby

Installing Ruby with package managers (apt, yum, pacman) can cause issues. We recommend using a Ruby version manager instead, like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). Here's how to set it up:

1. First, clone the rbenv repo into `~/.rbenv`:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
```

2. Install [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) as an rbenv plugin, which will add the `rbenv install` command:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
```

3. Add rbenv to your path and initialize it by adding the following to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

4. Reload the current shell to get access to rbenv:
```bash
$ source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.bash_profile
```

5. [Install packages](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build/wiki#suggested-build-environment) to prepare your build environment.

6. Install the latest version of Ruby (2.5.1 in this case), and don't build the documentation (saves time, plus it's all online anyways):
```bash
$ CONFIGURE_OPTS="--disable-install-doc" rbenv install 2.5.1 --verbose
```

7. Set Ruby 2.5.1 as the global default:
```bash
$ rbenv global 2.5.1
```

8. Skip building documentation when installing gems:
```bash
$ echo "gem: --no-document" > ~/.gemrc
```

9. Check to make sure everything works:
```
$ rbenv versions
  system
* 2.5.1 (set by /home/<me>/.rbenv/version)
$ ruby -e "puts 'Hello Ruby'"
Hello Ruby
```

# Install Simple 2D

1. Ruby 2D requires a native graphics engine called Simple 2D, which relies on [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org). Install SDL packages for your Linux distribution.
- Ubuntu, Debian, and Mint:
```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
```
- CentOS and Fedora:
```bash
# Or `dnf install` on Fedora
sudo yum install SDL2-devel SDL2_image-devel SDL2_mixer-devel SDL2_ttf-devel
```
- openSUSE:
```bash
sudo zypper install libSDL2-devel libSDL2_image-devel libSDL2_mixer-devel libSDL2_ttf-devel
```
- Arch:
```bash
sudo pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf
```

2. Next, download the source code for the [latest version of Simple 2D](https://github.com/simple2d/simple2d/releases/latest) and run:
```
make && sudo make install
```

# Install Ruby 2D

You're now ready to install the gem!

```
gem install ruby2d
```

That's it! Head back to the "get started" guide and [write your first 2D app Â»](/learn/get-started#writing-your-first-2d-app)
