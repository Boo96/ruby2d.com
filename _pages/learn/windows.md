# Requirements

Ruby 2D works with 64-bit Windows and is tested on the latest releases of Windows 10, but will probably work with previous versions as well. Although there are several ways to install Ruby on Windows, Ruby 2D needs a [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org) environment to run. We recommend using the [RubyInstaller for Windows](https://rubyinstaller.org) to install Ruby, which is built with MinGW.

If you don't yet have Ruby installed, follow the instructions below. Otherwise, skip ahead to the next section.

# Installing Ruby

1. Download and install [RubyInstaller for Windows](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads). This must be an `x64` version â€” here's a direct link to download the latest release, [Ruby 2.3.3 (x64)](https://dl.bintray.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/rubyinstaller-2.3.3-x64.exe). When choosing an install path, we recommend something simple, like `C:\ruby`

2. Download and install the corresponding RubyInstaller Development Kit (DevKit), also available on the [downloads page](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads). Here's a direct link to download the [Ruby 2.0 x64 DevKit](https://dl.bintray.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2-20130224-1432-sfx.exe). Extract it to a simple place, like `C:\devkit`

3. Open the Ruby command prompt (find it by searching for "Start Command Prompt with Ruby") and enter the DevKit directory, for example with `cd C:\devkit`

4. Initialize and install the DevKit by running:
```
ruby dk.rb init
ruby dk.rb install
```

5. To add MinGW tools to your command prompt, run the `devkitvars.bat` script, for example using `C:\devkit\devkitvars.bat`

6. Add `/usr/local/bin` to your path, for example by running:
```
set PATH=%PATH%;c:\devkit\local\bin
```

For additional help with the DevKit, see the [RubyInstaller wiki](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit).
