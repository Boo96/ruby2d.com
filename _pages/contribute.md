Ruby 2D is an entirely open-source project built by dedicated folks who believe creating 2D applications should be simple and fun. Remember to [check the news](/news) for the latest updates and [join the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ruby2d) to stay connected with the community.

There are a number of ways you can get involved:

- **Implement new features**
Ruby 2D is still early in development, so there are plenty of new things to implement. Check out the [roadmap](/roadmap) in the documentation, choose a feature (or suggest a new one on the mailing list), and get started.

- **Submit and fix issues**
Like any project under heavy development, there are bound to be issues. Your help identifying and fixing them will be critical in ensuring others will have a solid experience using the library. Check out the [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/ruby2d/ruby2d/issues) and have at it!

- **Write and review documentation**
Every great open-source project has great documentation. We're off to a good start with this project site, but there is so much more to write. At the bottom of every page (including this one), there's an "improve this content" link in order to make corrections and suggestions as simple as possible.

- **Create and improve examples**
We have a few sample applications for folks to get started, but would like to see many more. Head over to the mailing list to suggest new ones we could add to the [examples repository](https://github.com/ruby2d/examples).

- **Respond to questions on the mailing list**
We hope the mailing list will be a vibrant forum to discuss new features, ideas, resolve issues, and more. We'd love more people to help respond to inquiries and problem as they come up.
